# EDA_Autoviz

### Autoviz is a Python library that generates visualizations for data analysis with minimal coding. It is designed to help data scientists and analysts quickly explore their data and identify patterns and insights.

### The library uses a combination of statistical algorithms and heuristics to automatically select the most appropriate visualization for a given dataset. It can handle both numerical and categorical data and can generate a variety of plots, including scatter plots, bar charts, histograms, and more.

### Autoviz is built on top of matplotlib and seaborn, which are widely used data visualization libraries in Python. However, unlike these libraries, Autoviz does not require users to specify the type of plot they want to create or to customize the plot settings. Instead, Autoviz automatically creates the best possible visualization based on the data.

### Autoviz can save data analysts and data scientists time and effort by automating the visualization process and allowing them to focus on interpreting the results rather than creating plots.
